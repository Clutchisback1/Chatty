# Installation Instructions üìù


### TLDR;

* Generate and add your API Key to the `API_KEY` paramter in Chatty.py
* If you get errors saying that you reached your limit you have to add a payment method to your profile
  * FYI: Shit's super cheap...While developing this app, I sent quite a few requests and it only cost a penny by the time this app was finished...Took a day to write
* Once you have your API key added you should be good to proceed like normal
* If you get missing module errors on the openai import or anything like that just pip install it and you should be good there as well
