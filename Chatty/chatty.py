### TLDR;

# Generate and add your API Key to the paramter in this script
# If you get errors saying you reached your limit you have to add a payment method
# Shit's super cheap...While developing this I sent quite a few request and it only cost a penny by the time this app was finished...Took a day to write
# Once you have your API key added you should be good to proceed like normal
# If you get missing module errors on the openai import or anything like that just pip install it


### Generating the Chat GPT API Key Instructions and using it for Chatty

# 1. Go to the ChatGPT website at https://www.chatgpt.com/api/.
# 2. Click on the "Get API Key" button located in the top right corner of the page.
# 3. Sign up for a ChatGPT account by providing your name, email address, and a password. If you already have an account, log in with your credentials.
# 4. Once you have signed up or logged in, you will be redirected to the API key generation page.
# 5. You will be prompted to choose a package for your API key. Select the package that best suits your needs and click on the "Subscribe" button.
# 6. Enter your payment information...It's super cheap trust me...One day of use while developing this tool only cost me a penny
# 7. After completing the payment process, you will be redirected to the API key generation page.
# 8. Your API key will be displayed on the page, along with instructions on how to use it.

# Note: Please keep your API key secure and do not share it with unauthorized personnel. To ensure that your data is protected, please follow the best practices for API key management.
